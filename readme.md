# About this project

## Background

I am a graduate from Noroff Vocational School studying frontend development. This website is my delivery for semester project 2, which is a major project spanning over the course of five weeks in the end of our third semester.

This webpage is an online store for a fictional company called Sarif industries who is manufactoring and selling robotic human parts called human augmentations.

## User interface

The centerpiece of this website is the user interface found [here](https://sp2-mariussolheim.netlify.app/store.html). I had to make this png and use HTML map to create clickable zones over the png. When you click on the arms, you get a list of arm augmentations, same with the head, legs, torso and chest.

## Tech used

* Vanilla JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap CDN
* Strapi CMS

I made my own functions for managing DOM manipulation, as it became quite strenuous without it. You can find these functions [here](https://github.com/Masteesol/semester_project_2/blob/main/js/utils/manage-elements.js).

> "I really like the look and feel of the website! The animations, the use of complimentary colours and the general UI is really good! This is extremely unique and I have never seen this idea or concept ever before! Very impressive way of representing an online store in this manner!"
